        //When we run any javascript code GEC is created
        //GEC=Global Execution Context
        //There is 2 Execution Phase in GEC, 1. Memory Creation Phase 2. Execution Phase
        //For every function call new GEC is created one inside another
        //In memory creation phase, All variables and functions are stored
        //Then in Execution phase it checks if variable already exists in memory creation phase

         //Hoisting
         //In memory creation phase, All variables and functions are stored, it is known as hoisting

         //1 For var

         //2 For let

         //output=Uncaught ReferenceError: Cannot access 'b' before initialization

         //3 For const

         const c=8;

         //Temporal Dead Zone=Time duration between variable declaration and initialisation of let and const variables
