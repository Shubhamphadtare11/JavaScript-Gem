        //Debouncing and Throttling

        //Debouncing are 2 ways to optimise event handling in javascript
        //It limits the execution of function call and waits for a certain amount of time before running it again
        //Debouncing example=when we open flipkart website, while searching, it dont make api call right away, it waits for user stopping while typing for 400ms and then it makes another api call for search results, it is known as debouncing

        //Throttlig=While scrolling in twitter, when scrollbar comes to at certain limit event call will happen for new search results and fetches more posts
        //It is done by adding throttling in scroll action in web page, so user will get infinite scrolling effect
        //It limits the execution of event handler function when the event is triggered continously due to user actions
