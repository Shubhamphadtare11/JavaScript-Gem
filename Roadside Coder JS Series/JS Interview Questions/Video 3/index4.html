      //Output=undefined
      //when we have variable after or before in console.log local scope we will not go to global scope
      //this is beacuse first memory creation phase is created then execution phase created for every scope, first global scope var x =21 stored, then for fun function again memory creation phase is created then execution phase created so var x is still undefined, therefore output is undefined

      fun1();
      
      //here no var is declared inside function thats why output is printed
